            <h2>About Us</h2>
            
            <p>Hi! My name is Jeff Perkins and I own and Operate Ocho's Custom Creations.
                Ocho is my nickname I earned at work (long story) and became a bit of an alter ego
                I suppose. Frankly... I needed an alter ego.<br>In August of 2022 I found myself facing
                some personal struggles that came to a head. It did not take much internal reflection
                and I decided that I needed to end my relationship with alcohol. A visionary friend of mine<br>
                presented me with an idea, some encouragement and made it impossible for me to say no 
                to starting a small local business. Always having an interest in my creative side and 
                a long desire to start a small business, here we are.
            </p>
            <p>
                Turn Any photo into a custom wall art!!
                Any image (and I mean ANY!) can be converted and cut. It is impossible to offend me. And YES! I can keep a secret.
